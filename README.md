HEROIC assessed the health and economic impacts of urban scale interventions to reduce overheating in a range of cities in different climate zones and in different socio-economic settings. 

HEROIC was a Wellcome Trust funded project that ran from 2020-2024, led by [Clare Heaviside](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/77627-clare-heaviside).
